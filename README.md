# youtubeMusic
This is an electron wrapper written around YouTube Music for desktop users.

# Inspiration
Inspired by https://github.com/Mik1337/instagram

This is a GG idea. I really need a YTMusic app for myself.

I'mma just be converting the original instagram app to a YT app.

### Compile the code and run it
```
$ git clone https://github.com/krishnamurthypranesh/youtubeMusic
$ cd youtubeMusic
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
# Don't Sell This
Welp, don't go selling this. Pliss.

# Not Official
This project is not official. I'm making this for me and someother kindred spirits. 
Then again, this is better than what Google is currently offerring (nothing).
